        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Below you may find a section with examples of my previous work. In fact, this site itself is one project I have undertaken as a part of the
            University of Oregon full stack coding bootcamp! I originally enrolled in this bootcamp to facilitate a change in careers. At the bottom of the page you can find 
            contact information including my phone number, email address, and a link to my github account.

    <!-- Section three: Work. This is the main section of the site. Includes a "Work" title, and several cards that act as links to my work. The links should have some form of
    animation on them when you hover over them. The first card should be unique and take up extra space. -->
